## UFO API

The UFO API is a collection of UFO Sigthings served through an API.

The original dataset is coming from [The National UFO Reporting Center]<http://www.nuforc.org/>. The data has been modified and augmented with location data, to allow for easier querying and location based queries.

An example of a visualization using this data can be found [here]<http://ufo.joakimquach.com>.

The API is currently hosted <https://ufo-api.herokuapp.com/api>

This project is created by Joakim Gregersen Quach for the class Designing for Data Personalization taught by Sam Slover at ITP, NYU.
